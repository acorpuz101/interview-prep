## JavaScript Fundamentals:

- Data types (objects, arrays, strings, numbers).
- Scope and closures.
- Functions and callbacks.
- Differentiate between undefined and null.
- Promises and asynchronous programming.
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals, destructuring).
- Describe the difference between var, let, and const.
- Explain the difference between == and ===.
- What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?

## Node.js Basics:
- Understanding of Node.js architecture.
- Modules and require.
- npm (package management).
- Event-driven programming with EventEmitter.

## Express.js Framework:

- Creating routes and handling HTTP methods.
- Middleware and its significance.
- Templating engines (e.g., Handlebars, EJS).
- Error handling in Express.

## Asynchronous JavaScript:

- Callbacks, Promises, and async/await.
- Understanding the event loop.
- Handling concurrency and avoiding callback hell.
- Describe the difference between Promise.all and Promise.race.

## ES6 and Modern JavaScript:

- What are arrow functions and how do they differ from regular functions?
- Explain the purpose of the spread operator (...).
- What are template literals?
- Describe destructuring assignment.

## RESTful APIs:

- Design principles for RESTful APIs.
- CRUD operations and HTTP methods.
- Status codes and response formats (JSON).

## Database Interaction:

- Connecting to databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) using drivers.
- Basic CRUD operations.
- Mongoose or another ODM/ORM if applicable.

## Middleware:

- Writing custom middleware functions.
- Understanding the order of middleware execution.
- Implementing third-party middleware.

## Security:

- Best practices for handling user input (sanitization, validation).
- Authentication and authorization.
- Handling sensitive data and securing APIs.

## Testing:

- Writing unit tests using frameworks like Mocha or Jest.
- Mocking and stubbing.
- End-to-end testing with tools like Supertest.

## WebSockets (Optional):

- Understanding real-time communication.
- Using libraries like Socket.io.

## Deployment and Hosting:

- Deploying Node.js applications.
- Familiarity with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- Configuring environment variables.

## Performance Optimization:

- Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks.
- Caching strategies.
- Load balancing.

## Version Control:

- Using Git for version control.
- Branching and merging strategies.

## Soft Skills:

- Communication skills.
- Problem-solving approach.
- Collaboration and teamwork.
